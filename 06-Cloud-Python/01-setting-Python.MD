## Setting up Python
## Introduction:
For a lot of IT jobs, some basic programming knowledge is required. You do not have to be able to write a script from scratch, or understand complex algorithms. You will have to be able to understand and modify code snippets to fit your needs.
For this, it is important to learn the basic principles of programming. Python is often considered the easiest programming language to learn, because the syntax is very simple.
When installing Python, make sure to add Python to your PATH variable (even if you’re on Windows).

In order to start writing code, you’ll need an IDE. The most popular IDE is Visual Studio Code (VS Code), because it is free, lightweight, easy to use, and there are a lot of plug-ins available for high customizability.

## Key-words
IDE:
An integrated development environment (IDE): is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).

IDEs can perform a variety of functions. Notable ones include write code, compile code, debug code, and monitor resources. Examples of IDEs include NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio.

VSC:
Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

## Exercise:
•	Install the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/
•	Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download
•	Install the Python plug-in in VS Code.
•	Write the following Python code. The output in the terminal should be the text “Hello world!”
