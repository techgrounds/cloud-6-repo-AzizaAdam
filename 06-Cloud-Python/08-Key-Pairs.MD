## Key-value pairs
## Introduction:
Key-value pairs are a general concept you will definitely encounter. Some examples of where you will find them are NoSQL databases or AWS resource tags. Dictionaries (dict) in Python also use key-value pairs to store information.

Dicts in Python are written using curly brackets {}. You can get values from the dict by calling its key. 
## Exercise 1:
•	Create a new script.
•	Create a dictionary with the following keys and values:
Key	Value
First name	Coen
Last name	Meulenkamp
Job title	Learning Coach
Company	TechGrounds
•	Loop over the dictionary and print every key-value pair in the terminal.

## Exercise 2:
•	Create a new script.
•	Use user input to ask for their information (first name, last name, job title, company). Store the information in a dictionary.
•	Write the information to a csv file (comma-separated values). The data should not be overwritten when you run the script multiple times.
