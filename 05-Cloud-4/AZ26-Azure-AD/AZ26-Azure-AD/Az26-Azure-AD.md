## Azure Active Directory
Azure AD is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. When you connect Active Directory with Azure AD, Microsoft can help protect you by detecting suspicious sign-in attempts at no extra cost. For example, Azure AD can detect sign-in attempts from unexpected locations or unknown devices.

Azure AD Connect synchronizes user identities between on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD. Azure AD Connect synchronizes changes between both identity systems, so you can use features like SSO, multifactor authentication, and self-service password reset under both systems. Self-service password reset prevents users from using known compromised passwords.
AAD is used by:
IT administrators
App developers
Users
Online service subscribers

## Services provided by ADD
Authentication
Single sign-on
SSO enables you to remember only one username and one password to access multiple applications. A single identity is tied to a user, which simplifies the security model. 

Application management
You can manage your cloud and on-premises apps by using Azure AD.

Device management
Along with accounts for individual people, Azure AD supports the registration of devices.
## Key-terms
## Authentication
Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person or service that wants to access a resource.

## Authorization
Authentication establishes the user's identity, but authorization is the process of establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has.

## Single sign-on (SSO)

## Multifactor authentication
Multifactor authentication is a process where a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification. Examples include a code on their mobile phone or a fingerprint scan.
These elements fall into three categories:
•	Something the user knows
This might be an email address and password.
•	Something the user has
This might be a code that's sent to the user's mobile phone.
•	Something the user is
This is typically some sort of biometric property, such as a fingerprint or face scan that's used on many mobile devices.
Azure Active Directory Premium (P1 or P2 licenses) allows for comprehensive and granular configuration of Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication through Conditional Access policies
Self-service password reset (SSPR)
Prevents users from using known compromised password
