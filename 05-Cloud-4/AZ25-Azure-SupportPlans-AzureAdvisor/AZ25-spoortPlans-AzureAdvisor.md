## Azure support plans
When your organization uses Azure Cloud services, it can take advantage of different support plans options to resolve issues. The support option chosen to deal with a particular issue depends on:
•	The tool or service where the issue has arisen.
•	The type of subscription your organization uses.
•	The kind of support your organization needs.

## Azure advisor
Azure Advisor is a free service built into Azure that provides best practice recommendations for your workloads. These recommendations are personalized and actionable. They help you assess your Azure workloads against the five pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework (Cost optimization, Reliability, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency and Security “CROPS”)

Advisor analyzes your resource configuration and usage telemetry and then gives you actionable recommendations that can help you improve the cost effectiveness, performance, reliability, and security of your Azure resources, as well as your operational excellence.
## Advisor Score.
Advisor Score is a rating of your Azure subscriptions on a scale from 0% to 100% to help you understand how well the resources in those subscriptions are optimized, based on our documented best practices.
