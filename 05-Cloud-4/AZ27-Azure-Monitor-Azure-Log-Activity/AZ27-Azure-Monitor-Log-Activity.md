## Azure Monitor
Azure, monitoring is a service to collect insights into the operation, performance, and behavior of your applications and services. Azure Monitor is enabled by default. As soon as you create an Azure subscription and start adding resources, such as web apps, Azure Monitor starts collecting data.

Interactive monitoring is just one way to utilize the features of Azure Monitor by setting alerts that send sms or emails to a person on charge or to perform specific actions.

## Azure Monitoring Agent
The Azure Monitor agent (AMA) collects monitoring data from the guest operating system of virtual machines and delivers it to Azure Monitor.
You can perform monitoring as a near real-time event or review the data later. Metrics can also be reviewed later as they are stored for 93 days by default. Whatever your preferred method, Azure Monitor is ready to help you collect the necessary information that you need.

Azure Monitor is a service for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments.

zure Monitor includes Insights, which are out-of-the box monitoring and troubleshooting experiences for Azure resources. Available Insights include Azure Monitor VM insights, Azure Monitor application insights, and Azure Monitor container insights.

## Azure Log activity
Activity logs record when resources are created or modified. You can use the information in the activity logs to trace the history of the resource creation and modifications. Metrics tell you how the resource is performing and any other resources that it's consuming.
