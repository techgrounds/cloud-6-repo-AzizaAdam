## AZ21-Azure Storage

Azure storage is a Microsoft storage solution for storage services for massive data and data objects. It is scalable, secure, reliable and easy accessible storage account that fits diverse types of data structured and unstructured (files, tables, images, movie’s, datasheet, etc). two types of tiers ## Standard and ## Premium (for developers with more options).

Azure storage replicates data using several options:

1-	Local redundant storage (LRS) (to prevent Hard disk failure, update failure)

2-	Geo-redundant storage (GRS) (to fault tolerance, replicate to region pair asynchrously)

3-	Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) (high availability)

4-	Read-access GRS

5-	Geo-zone RS


## Key-terms

•	## Azure Blob Storage

Azure Blob Storage is an object storage solution for the cloud. It can store massive amounts of data, such as text or binary data. Azure Blob Storage is unstructured, meaning that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold. Blob Storage can manage thousands of simultaneous uploads, massive amounts of video data, constantly growing log files, and can be reached from anywhere with an internet connection.
Blob Storage is ideal for:

•	Serving images or documents directly to a browser.

•	Storing files for distributed access.

•	Streaming video and audio.

•	Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.

•	Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

•	Storing up to 8 TB of data for virtual machines.

•	## Azure Disk Storage

Disk Storage provides disks for Azure virtual machines. Applications and other services can access and use these disks as needed, similar to how they would in on-premises scenarios. 

Disk Storage allows data to be persistently stored and accessed from an attached virtual hard disk. ou can use standard SSD and HDD disks for less critical workloads, premium SSD disks for mission-critical production applications, and ultra disks for data-intensive workloads such as SAP HANA, top tier databases, and transaction-heavy workloads.

•	## Azure Files Storage

Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block and Network File System (preview) protocols. Azure file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, Linux, and macOS. Applications running in Azure virtual machines or cloud services can mount a file storage share to access file data, just as a desktop application would mount a typical SMB share. Any number of Azure virtual machines or roles can mount and access the file storage share simultaneously. Typical usage scenarios would be to share files anywhere in the world, diagnostic data, or application data sharing.

Use Azure Files for the following situations:

•	Many on-premises applications use file shares. Azure Files makes it easier to migrate those applications that share data to Azure. 

•	Store configuration files on a file share and access them from multiple VMs. 

•	Write data to a file share, and process or analyze the data later like diagnostic logs, metrics, and crash dumps.

The following illustration shows Azure Files being used to share data between two geographical locations.

one thing that distinguishes Azure Files from files on a corporate file share is that you can access the files from anywhere in the world, by using a URL that points to the file. You can also use Shared Access Signature (SAS) tokens to allow access to a private asset for a specific amount of time.


•	## Azure Queue Storage

Storage queue is a middleware service, for reliable cross-messaging and events between different application components. It is composed of queues, each contains multiple message.

•	## Azure Table storage

It is a NoSQL storage foe schema less or semi-structured data. It is highly good and scalable.

•	## Azure Blob Access tiers

To manage costs for your expanding storage needs, it's helpful to organize your data based on attributes like frequency of access and planned retention period.

The available access tiers include:

•	Hot access tier: Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently (for example, images for your website).

•	
•	Cool access tier: Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (for example, invoices for your customers).
•	
•	Archive access tier: Appropriate for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency requirements (for example, long-term backups). Archive storage stores data offline and offers the lowest storage costs, but also the highest costs to rehydrate and access data.


Only the hot and cool access tiers can be set at the account level. The archive access tier isn't available at the account level.
Hot, cool, and archive tiers can be set at the blob level, during upload or after upload.
