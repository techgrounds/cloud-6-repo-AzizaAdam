## Azure SQL Database

Azure SQL Database is a relational database based on the latest stable version of the Microsoft SQL Server database engine. SQL Database is a high-performance, reliable, fully managed, and secure database. You can use it to build data-driven applications and websites in the programming language of your choice, without needing to manage infrastructure.

## Exercise
## Task 1:
Create a SQL database in Azure and then query the data in that database.

## Task 2: Test the database

Congratulations! You've created a SQL database in Azure and successfully queried the data in that database.
.

## CosmosDB 
Azure Cosmos DB is designed to provide low latency, elastic scalability of throughput, well-defined semantics for data consistency, and high availability.
You can configure your databases to be globally distributed and available in any of the Azure regions. To lower the latency, place the data close to where your users are. Choosing the required regions depends on the global reach of your application and where your users are located.
With Azure Cosmos DB, you can add or remove the regions associated with your account at any time. Your application doesn't need to be paused or redeployed to add or remove a region.
Currently, you can create a maximum of 50 Azure Cosmos accounts under an Azure subscription (this is a soft limit that can be increased via support request). 

Azure Cosmos DB provides native support for wire protocol-compatible APIs for popular databases. These include MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, and Gremlin. When using Gremlin API the default consistency level configured on the Azure Cosmos account is used.
