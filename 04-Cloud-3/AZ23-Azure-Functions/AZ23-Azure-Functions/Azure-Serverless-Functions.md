## Event Grid, Service Bus 	

Azure Event Grid is deeply integrated with Azure services and can be integrated with third-party services. It simplifies event consumption and lowers costs by eliminating the need for constant polling. Event Grid efficiently and reliably routes events from Azure and non-Azure resources, and distributes the events to registered subscriber endpoints.
