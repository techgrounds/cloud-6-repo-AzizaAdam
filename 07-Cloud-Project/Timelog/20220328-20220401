Deoplying my version 1.1 I get errors with the vnet module
 
## Obstakels
errors related to deploying many interrelated resources in one module
 
## Oplossingen
 I broke the vnet module into vnet and peering modules
## Learnings
I understood that even u have a good script it may not run just bcz of too much related resources like nic, ip, nsg, peering all depends on subnets so breaking down modules into small easy digestable to the resource manager will help avoiding this errors.
